machine learning involves:
1. import the data, csv file
2. clean the data, removing duplicate data, depends on the value of the data
3. split te data into training / test sets
4. create a model, selecting a algorithm to analyze the data
5. train the model, look for the pattern
6. make predictions, ask to make a predictions
7. evaluate and improve, measure their accuracy, choose another model that will produce more accurate results, or fine tune the parameters of the model

libraries:
1. Numpy - very popular library, multidimensional array
2. Pandas- data analysis library that provides concept called data frame, data frame is a two dimensional data structure similar to an excel spreadsheet, very popular for machine learning and data science projects
3. MatPlotLib - two dimensional plotting library for creating graphs on plots
4. Scikit-Learn - one of the most popular machine learning libraries that provides all these common algorithms like decision trees, neural networks and so on.

Jupyter - writing our code, easier to perform here than vs code for machine learning and inspecting data
